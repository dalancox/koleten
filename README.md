# React-Portfolioüìú
 - Built a React portfolio as a good intro to my experience using react. Very different and very versitile comparably speaking of course. Personally I found that making this using react was a whole lot easier than doing it in HTML & JS. I didnt have to write near as many lines of code as I did with my first portfolio.

# Built Using üöß
- HTML 
- CSS 
- Figma
- React
- JavaScript 

# Trials I Experienced ü§¨
- Making sure the Imports on every page were input correctly. 
- Creating the Virtical Timeline was a little difficult; I have never attempted a design method such as that.
- Embedding links inside each of the social icons as well as the Email icon specifically; that one was a little more difficult as I have never linked my email anywhere other than a "Contact Me" section on my normal portfolio using HTML & JS. Ultimately I got things done and it turned out really well I think.

# Continued Devolopment:
- Add links to all my projects not just placholders. Some of my projects are broken right now and need a little fixing so I decided to wait on them until I fix them.
- Add more experience as I gain it along with continued education if I take any other classes/courses.

## Available Scripts if forking repo

!!MAKE SURE TO INSTALL DEPENDENCIES!!

### 'npm install'

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
